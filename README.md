These are my assignment attempts for the coursera Princeton algos course, part 1. They may not be that great and on the whole incomplete, PLEASE DO NOT USE / CHEAT WITH THEM. I'm no expert on algos, I'm just interested. Feel free to browse out of interest, but do not trust me. Only my first two are "correct", they go downhill after that. Partially because I started playing Red Orchestra 2 a lot more but also because I got distracted by other more interesting programming related things.

Do the course, try your best, but don't feel bad if you get distracted by other productive / fun things. My interest just trailed off towards the end.

PLEASE DO NOT USE ANYTHING HERE TO CHEAT ON THE COURSE

I AM NOT TO BE TRUSTED
